# mullvad-polybar

A small script to add a one click solution to your polybar when you are a (Mullvad)[https://mullvad.net] user. Heavily inspired by [shervinsahba/polybar-vpn-controller](https://github.com/shervinsahba/polybar-vpn-controller), but I rewrote this to remove unnecessary stuff and to have a cleaned up version. Thanks for the inspiration!

## Usage:

Left click: connect/disconnect
Right click: Select relay
Middle click: Copy IP

See [shervinsahba/polybar-vpn-controller](https://github.com/shervinsahba/polybar-vpn-controller).

## Requirements:

(ROFI)[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi]
(Polybar)[https://github.com/polybar/polybar]
(Mullvad client)[https://mullvad.net/en/download/linux/]
